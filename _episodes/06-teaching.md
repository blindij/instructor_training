# Teaching CodeRefinery lessons

We will now split into groups and study, teach and discuss the 
CodeRefinery lessons.

> ## Bad and good living coding examples
>  
> Teaching by live coding is a performance art which requires practice.
> This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors 
> fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them. 
> Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
> - Watch first [this video](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE)
> - Then watch [this video](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
> - How is the second round of teaching better than the first? 
> - Is there anything that was better in the first than in the second?
> - Please give feedback in the shared workshop document.
