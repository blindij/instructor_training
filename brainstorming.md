# Planning document for the instructor training workshop

## Random points

- Apart from teaching how to teach, we should include a section
  on how to develop a lesson from scratch
- We should cover several important concepts (many borrowed from Carpentries):
  - learner profiles
  - mind maps
  - cognitive load
  - having clear take-home messages from each lesson/episode
  - etc...

## Exercises

### Hands-on teaching

- split into groups of 3
- select a CR lesson episode from a list that we've compiled
- each group member prepares their episode for 5-10 minutes
- each member "teachers" the episode to the others
- the others give constructive feedback
- after exercise, whole room discusses difficulties encountered and lessons learned

### Designing an exercise

- Split into groups
- Each group member designs a new exercise
  - either something original
  - or from a list of suggested simple technical topics (e.g. how to do X with Git)
- each member "teaches" the exercise, explains it to the other members, 
  other members solve the exercise and give feedback
