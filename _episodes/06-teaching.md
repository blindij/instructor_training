# CodeRefinery lessons

We will now split into groups and study, teach and discuss the 
CodeRefinery lessons. Each participant will join one group in each 
of the three sessions.

> ## Bad and good live coding examples

> Teaching by live coding is a 
> [performance art which requires practice](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:performance-exercises).
> This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors 
> fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them. 
> Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
> - Watch first [this video](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE)
> - Then watch [this video](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
> - How is the second round of teaching better than the first? 
> - Is there anything that was better in the first than in the second?
> - Please give feedback in the shared workshop document.

## Lesson discussions 

- Each group will have a CodeRefinery instructor who will introduce 
  the lesson and guide the discussions. 
- Discussions may lead to suggestions for improvements in either lessons 
  or lesson instructor guides. These should be recorded as issues to 
  lesson repositories.
- The format will be flexible and should be adapted to the specifics of 
  each lesson, but a starting point can be:
  1. The instructor gives a high-level overview of the lesson and 
     reviews the instructor guide.
  2. Discussion of the intended learning outcomes and lesson episode structure.
  3. Episodes are distributed between subgroups (2-4 people), who study the 
     material.
  4. Within subgroups, participants study the episode, discuss it, and (if 
     relevant) take turns to present and live-code selected parts for 3-5 
     minutes. The other subgroup participants give feedback.
  5. Subgroups present thoughts and conclusions to the whole group.
  6. Steps 3-5 are repeated with a different distribution of episodes if 
     time allows.
  7. Instructor guide is again reviewed based on the discussions and 
     improvements are made directly or via issues.
